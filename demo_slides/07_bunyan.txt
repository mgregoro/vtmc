% Bunyan
% JSON-formatted Logging Library

* Written by Trent Mick (Joyent)
      ~trentm/node-bunyan~ on github

* Logs should be formatted for ~machines~,
    not for ~people~

* Use a filter to make them human-readable

* Log auditing information at INFO to files

* Log verbosely (off by default) to DEBUG, and
     consume those logs via DTrace probes (bunyan -p)
     (uses ~node-dtrace-provider~!)
