% General Development Tips

* Compile C/C++ code with ~-fno-omit-frame-pointer~,
     so that stack traces work in DTrace and mdb(1)

* Prefix your property names, making them easier to
     find when debugging core files, e.g.

    ~var~ iface = { ~if_id~:     0x3423,
                  ~if_name~:   'interface 0',
                  ~if_ipaddr~: '192.168.1.1' };

* Name your 'anonymous' functions, making them easier
     to identify in stack traces
