% Post-mortem Debugging

* Traditionally done for C software on UNIX systems

* A program could call ~abort()~, or some signals
   (e.g. ~SIGSEGV~) would end the program and write
   a ~core file~

* The program can be restarted immediately so that
   ~service~ may be restored

* Engineers can inspect this ~core file~ later with
   a debugger, similar to a black box flight recorder

* Operators may also generate a core file ~without~
   interrupting the program using ~gcore(1)~
