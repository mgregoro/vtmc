% Post-mortem Debugging in Node.js

* From ~node v0.10.8~ onwards, we can ~abort()~ on
    an uncaught exception by using:

      node \
        ~--abort-on-uncaught-exception~ \
        app.js

* This preserves the stack that caused the exception
    in the core file, where we can see it in the
    debugger

* ~Use this flag everywhere!~
